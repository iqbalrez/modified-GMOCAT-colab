            "Consider a database that stores names, addresses and unique IDs of employees in a fitness centre. The employees are classified into three categories: trainers, administrators and technicians. Each trainer has one or more specialities, e.g., weight gain, weight loss, strength building, etc. An administrator can register new members and be reached through a landline phone number. Each member is identified by an email address. The fitness centre organises fitness classes for members. Each class has a name, a start date, an end date, and a daily time slot. No two fitness classes have the same daily time slot, and for each fitness class the start date must be before the end date. A member may choose to participate in one or more fitness classes and may also choose one of the trainers as their personal trainer. Each fitness class is attended by one or more members and instructed by only one trainer. Not all trainers deliver fitness classes. After receiving the approval from an administrator, a member may choose to add multiple associate members who will have partial access to the services provided by the fitness centre, and an associate number (i.e., 1, 2, . . .) and the name of each associate member are recorded in the database. The database keeps track of equipment available in the fitness centre. Each piece of equipment has a unique ID and must have one of the following three status types: new, working or broken.

            "Consider a database that stores names, addresses and unique IDs of employees in a fitness centre. The employees are classified into three categories: trainers, administrators and technicians. Each trainer has one or more specialities, e.g., weight gain, weight loss, strength building, etc. An administrator can register new members and be reached through a landline phone number. Each member is identified by an email address. The fitness centre organises fitness classes for members. Each class has a name, a start date, an end date, and a daily time slot. No two fitness classes have the same daily time slot, and for each fitness class the start date must be before the end date. A member may choose to participate in one or more fitness classes and may also choose one of the trainers as their personal trainer. Each fitness class is attended by one or more members and instructed by only one trainer. Not all trainers deliver fitness classes. After receiving the approval from an administrator, a member may choose to add multiple associate members who will have partial access to the services provided by the fitness centre, and an associate number (i.e., 1, 2, . . .) and the name of each associate member are recorded in the database. The database keeps track of equipment available in the fitness centre. Each piece of equipment has a unique ID and must have one of the following three status types: new, working or broken. Each technician has a mobile phone number. Technicians maintain equipment in the fitness centre and the database records the date of each maintenance event. Each piece of equipment should be maintained at least twice a year. Which of the following can be modelled as a weak entity type?\n",

            "Consider a database that stores names, addresses and unique IDs of employees in a fitness centre. The employees are classified into three categories: trainers, administrators and technicians. Each trainer has one or more specialities, e.g., weight gain, weight loss, strength building, etc. An administrator can register new members and be reached through a landline phone number.

A member may choose to participate in one or more fitness classes and may also choose one of the trainers as their personal trainer. Each fitness class is attended by one or more members and instructed by only one trainer. Not all trainers deliver fitness classes. After receiving the approval from an administrator, a member may choose to add multiple associate members who will have partial access to the services provided by the fitness centre, and an associate number (i.e., 1, 2, . . .) and the name of each associate member are recorded in the database. The database keeps track of equipment available in the fitness centre. Each piece of equipment has a unique ID and must have one of the following three status types: new, working or broken. Each technician has a mobile phone number. Technicians maintain equipment in the fitness centre and the database records the date of each maintenance event. Each piece of equipment should be maintained at least twice a year. Which of the following can be modelled as an entity type?\n",

            "Consider a database that stores names, addresses and unique IDs of employees in a fitness centre. The employees are classified into three categories: trainers, administrators and technicians. Each trainer has one or more specialities, e.g., weight gain, weight loss, strength building, etc. An administrator can register new members and be reached through a landline phone number. Each member is identified by an email address. The fitness centre organises fitness classes for members. Each class has a name, a start date, an end date, and a daily time slot. No two fitness classes have the same daily time slot, and for each fitness class the start date must be before the end date. A member may choose to participate in one or more fitness classes and may also choose one of the trainers as their personal trainer. Each fitness class is attended by one or more members and instructed by only one trainer. Not all trainers deliver fitness classes.
